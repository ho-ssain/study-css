## Lesson-1: Start

### what is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to control the presentation and styling of webpages written in HTML or XHTML. In simpler terms, CSS is what makes websites look good and visually appealing.

CSS:

1. **Styling Webpages**:

   - CSS is used to style the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall appearance of elements on a webpage.
   - It allows you to change how text, images, links, buttons, and other HTML elements look and behave.

2. **Separation of Concerns**:

   - CSS allows for the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS) and behavior (JavaScript).
   - This separation makes it easier to manage and update the styling of a website without having to change the underlying HTML structure.

3. **Selectors and Rules**:

   - CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styling rules to them.
   - For example, you can select all `<p>` elements and change their font size or select elements with a specific class and change their background color.

4. **Syntax**:

   - CSS rules consist of a selector, followed by a declaration block enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
   - Within the declaration block, you specify one or more property-value pairs separated by semicolons.
   - For example:

     ```css
     p {
       font-size: 16px;
       color: #333333;
     }
     ```

5. **Cascading and Specificity**:

   - CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets," which means that styles can cascade or flow from one element to another.
   - Specificity determines which styles take precedence when multiple conflicting styles are applied to the same element.

6. **Media Queries**:
   - CSS allows for responsive web design by using media queries to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as screen size, resolution, or orientation.
   - This enables websites to adapt and display optimally on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

In summary, CSS is a powerful language that controls the visual presentation of web content. It enables web designers and developers to customize the look and feel of websites, create engaging user experiences, and ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices.

### different ways of applying CSS to HTML

1. Basic Methods:
   - Inline Styles
   - Internal Styles
   - External Stylesheets
2. Advanced Methods:
   - CSS Frameworks
   - CSS-in-JS
   - Importing CSS in JavaScript Modules
   - Inline style Attribute in JSX (for React)

### Writing CSS

1. **Selector**:

   - A selector targets HTML elements that you want to style.
   - Selectors can be HTML elements, classes, IDs, attributes, or combinations of these.
   - Example selectors: `h1`, `.button`, `#header`, `[type="text"]`.

2. **Declaration Block**:

   - After the selector, you enclose the CSS declarations within curly braces `{}`.
   - Each declaration consists of a property and a value, separated by a colon `:`.
   - Multiple declarations are separated by semicolons `;`.
   - Example declaration block:

     ```css
     selector {
       property1: value1;
       property2: value2;
       /* more properties */
     }
     ```

## Lesson-2: Selectors

### Types of CSS Selectors

1. **Element Styles**:

   - Applying styles directly to HTML elements using element selectors.
   - Example:

     ```css
     h1 {
       color: blue;
       font-size: 24px;
     }
     ```

2. **Class Styles**:

   - Applying styles to elements with specific class names.
   - Example:

     ```css
     .button {
       background-color: #007bff;
       color: white;
       padding: 10px 20px;
     }
     ```

3. **ID Styles**:

   - Applying styles to elements with specific IDs.
   - Note: IDs should be unique within a document.
   - Example:

     ```css
     #header {
       background-color: #333;
       color: white;
       padding: 10px;
     }
     ```

4. **Attribute Styles**:

   - Applying styles to elements based on their attributes.
   - Example:

     ```css
     input[type="text"] {
       border: 1px solid #ccc;
       padding: 5px;
     }
     ```

5. **Pseudo-class Styles**:

   - Applying styles to elements based on their state or position.
   - Examples: `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus`, `:nth-child()`, etc.
   - Example:

     ```css
     button:hover {
       background-color: #ffcc00;
     }
     ```

6. **Pseudo-element Styles**:

   - Applying styles to parts of an element.
   - Examples: `::before`, `::after`, `::first-line`, `::first-letter`, etc.
   - Example:

     ```css
     p::first-line {
       font-weight: bold;
     }
     ```

7. **Grouping Styles**:

   - Grouping multiple selectors together to apply the same styles.
   - Example:

     ```css
     h1,
     h2,
     h3 {
       font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
     }
     ```

These are the main types of CSS rules or decorations we'll encounter when styling webpages. By understanding how to write CSS and the different ways to target elements, we can effectively style our HTML documents and create visually appealing websites.

## Lesson-3: CSS Colors

CSS colors are used to specify the color of text, backgrounds, borders, and other elements on a webpage. There are various ways to represent colors in CSS, including named colors, hexadecimal notation, RGB values, RGBA values, HSL values, and HSLA values. Let's discuss each of these:

1. **Named Colors**:

   - CSS provides a set of predefined color names that you can use directly in your stylesheets.
   - Examples: `red`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `black`, `white`, `orange`, etc.
   - Example usage: `color: red;`, `background-color: blue;`

2. **Hexadecimal Notation**:

   - Colors can be represented using hexadecimal notation, which consists of a hash `#` followed by three or six hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F).
   - The three-digit format represents RGB values in shorthand (e.g., `#f00` for red), and the six-digit format represents the full RGB color space (e.g., `#ff0000` for red).
   - Example usage: `color: #ff0000;`, `background-color: #00ff00;`

3. **RGB Values**:

   - RGB (Red, Green, Blue) notation represents colors using the intensities of the red, green, and blue components on a scale of 0 to 255.
   - Syntax: `rgb(redValue, greenValue, blueValue)`
   - Example usage: `color: rgb(255, 0, 0);`, `background-color: rgb(0, 255, 0);`

4. **RGBA Values**:

   - RGBA is similar to RGB, but with an additional alpha channel that specifies the opacity of the color (transparency), ranging from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).
   - Syntax: `rgba(redValue, greenValue, blueValue, alphaValue)`
   - Example usage: `color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);`, `background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.75);`

5. **HSL Values**:

   - HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) notation represents colors using the hue (color tone), saturation (color intensity), and lightness (brightness) components.
   - Hue is represented as an angle in degrees (0 to 360), while saturation and lightness are percentages (0% to 100%).
   - Syntax: `hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)`
   - Example usage: `color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);`, `background-color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%);`

6. **HSLA Values**:
   - Similar to HSL, but with an additional alpha channel for specifying opacity.
   - Syntax: `hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)`
   - Example usage: `color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5);`, `background-color: hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 0.75);`

By understanding these different color representations in CSS, you have the flexibility to choose the most suitable method based on your design requirements and preferences. Each notation has its advantages and use cases, allowing you to create visually appealing and harmonious color schemes for your webpages.

## Lesson-4: CSS Units

CSS units and sizes are used to define the dimensions, spacing, and positioning of elements on a webpage. They come in various types, each serving different purposes. Here's a brief overview of CSS units and sizes:

1. **Absolute Length Units**:

   - Absolute length units are fixed and do not change based on the viewport or device.
   - Examples:
     - `px` (pixels): Represents a single dot on a computer screen. Widely used for precise control over element sizes.
     - `in` (inches), `cm` (centimeters), `mm` (millimeters): Useful for print stylesheets, where physical measurements are required.
     - `pt` (points), `pc` (picas): Also used in print stylesheets, with 1 point equaling 1/72 of an inch, and 1 pica equaling 12 points.

2. **Relative Length Units**:

   - Relative length units are relative to another value, such as the font size or the size of the viewport.
   - Examples:
     - `em`: Represents the font size of the element itself. For example, `1em` is equal to the font size of the current element.
     - `rem`: Similar to `em`, but relative to the root element (`<html>`), making it more predictable.
     - `vw` (viewport width), `vh` (viewport height): Represents a percentage of the viewport width or height, respectively.
     - `vmin`, `vmax`: Represents the smaller or larger of `vw` and `vh`, respectively.

3. **Percentage Units**:

   - Percentage units are relative to another value, typically the parent element or the viewport.
   - Examples:
     - `%`: Represents a percentage of the parent element's size. For example, `50%` is half the size of the parent element.
     - `%`: Also used in conjunction with `vw` and `vh` to create responsive layouts based on the viewport size.

4. **Flexible Length Units**:

   - Flexible length units are based on a combination of absolute and relative values, allowing for more flexible and responsive layouts.
   - Examples:
     - `fr` (flex): Represents a fraction of the available space in a flex container. Used in CSS Flexbox layouts.
     - `ch`: Represents the width of the character "0" in the current font. Useful for aligning elements based on character width.

5. **Viewport-Percentage Units**:
   - Viewport-percentage units are relative to the size of the viewport, allowing for responsive designs based on the device's screen size.
   - Examples:
     - `vw` (viewport width): Represents a percentage of the viewport's width.
     - `vh` (viewport height): Represents a percentage of the viewport's height.
     - `vmin`, `vmax`: Represents the smaller or larger of `vw` and `vh`, respectively.

These CSS units and sizes provide flexibility and control over the layout and appearance of elements on a webpage. By understanding how to use them effectively, you can create responsive and visually appealing designs that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.

## Lesson-5: CSS Box Model

The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in CSS that describes the layout and rendering of elements on a webpage. It conceptualizes each HTML element as a rectangular box, comprising content, padding, borders, and margins. Here's a brief overview of the CSS Box Model:

1. **Content**:

   - The content area of an element represents the actual content, such as text, images, or other media, contained within the element.
   - The size of the content area is determined by the `width` and `height` properties specified in CSS.

2. **Padding**:

   - Padding is the space between the content area and the element's border.
   - It provides internal spacing within the element, separating the content from its borders.
   - Padding can be adjusted using the `padding` property in CSS, which accepts values in pixels, percentages, or other length units.

3. **Border**:

   - The border surrounds the padding area and visually separates the element's content from its surroundings.
   - Borders can have different styles (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.), widths, and colors.
   - Border properties include `border-width`, `border-style`, and `border-color`, among others.

4. **Margin**:
   - Margin is the space outside the element's border, separating it from other elements in the layout.
   - It creates space between adjacent elements, preventing them from visually merging.
   - Margins can be adjusted using the `margin` property in CSS, which accepts values in pixels, percentages, or other length units.

The total space occupied by an element, including its content, padding, border, and margin, is referred to as the "box" of the element. The size of the box is calculated as follows:

```css
Total width = width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left-width + border-right-width + margin-left + margin-right
Total height = height + padding-top + padding-bottom + border-top-width + border-bottom-width + margin-top + margin-bottom
```

Understanding the CSS Box Model is essential for accurately controlling the layout, spacing, and appearance of elements on a webpage. By adjusting the content, padding, borders, and margins of elements, designers and developers can create visually appealing and well-structured layouts that adapt to various screen sizes and devices.
